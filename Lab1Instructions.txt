Practice Lab 1
===============================
Your task: to design a program that computes a monthly insurance payment for a client given 
	the age of the client and number of doors on the car.

The problem: If a car has four doors and the driver's age is over 24, the premium is $650
	per year and is considered "low risk."  Otherwise, the premium is $1200 per year 
	and is considered "high risk."  There is a $5 monthly service charge.  Calculate
	the monthly payment and print the risk.

Output: Your output should have monthly payment and risk-look similar to:
	PAYMENT: $1000.00 /MONTH
	RISK: HIGH RISK

Advice: Use variables to store data such as the number of doors on the car and age of driver.
	Use if-else statements for flow control of the program.
	Write a formula that calculates monthly payment.

Completion: After completing this lab, verify your code with the posted code in the GitHub
	Repository (titled "Lab1Code.txt").  This file will contain the full program.
