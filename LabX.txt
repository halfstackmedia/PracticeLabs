LAB X

Challenge: Write a program that processes the test scores of a class.

Specifications: 
-The student information will be stored in a file of multiple students.
	-The file contains the ID and three test scores for the students
	-The file must read all student information (Use ifstream!)
	-The number of students per file will vary (hint: read until end of file)
-Your program must
	-Compute the average of each student's three test scores
	-Compute the letter grade of each student (refer to "Additional info")
	-Display this information in a table
	-After printing the table, print:
		-How many students are in the class
		-The class average
		-The ID and average of the student scoring the highest average
-Additional info
	-The letter grades are computed accordingly
	A: >=90
	B: >=80 && <90
	C: >=70 && <80
	D: >=60 && <70
	F: <60
	
Example of an input file:
-Contains ID, test 1, test 2, test 3 (respectively)
5569	95	100	90
4322	67	77	62
7945	80	91	67
5982	82	90	87

Example of output after reading the input file:

Student ID	Test1	Test2	Test3	Average	Grade
=================================================
5569		95		100		90		95.00	A
4322		67		77		62		68.67	D
7945		80		91		67		79.33	C
5982		82		90		87		86.33	B

Number of Students:	4
Class Average: 82.23
Student with highest average: 5569	95.00
